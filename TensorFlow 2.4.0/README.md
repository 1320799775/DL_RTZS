# DL_RTZS
A deep learning method for obtaining ultraclean pure shift NMR spectra. 

# Profiles
Real time ZS experimental data of quinine (divided into 2 spectra, according to the preprocessing method of dealing with spectral width of over 4096 Hz in the paper), azithromycin and strychnine:
1. exp/exp_quinine_1.txt
2. exp/exp_quinine_2.txt
3. exp/exp_azithromycin.txt
4. exp/exp_strychnine.txt

Model weight file (model_rtzs.h5) can be download from the weblink: https://www.dropbox.com/s/12v3bggv56fbytw/model_rtzs.h5. 'model_rtzs.h5' needs to be in the 'model' folder.

Model can be tested or used by the file:
1. modelTest.py

Model training code, using AC-ResNet and SM-CDMANE, is shown in the fileï¼š
1. modelTrain.py

The code for generating dataset is shown in the file:
1. dataset_rtZS.m

# Dependencies
Python == 3.6
1. keras == 2.2.4
2. numpy == 1.16.0
3. tensorfolw == 2.4.0
4. h5py == 3.1.0
5. matplotlib == 3.3.1

Model has been written and tested with the above dependencies. Performance with other module versions has not been tested.

Training code is based on old Keras version (Keras 2.2.4), so tensorflow 2.6 and later is not applicable.

# Generating Dataset
Dataset can be generated by running the program 'dataset_rtZS.m' in MATLAB.

# Training Model
Model can be trained by running the program 'modelTrain.py' in Python.

# Preparing Data for Testing
When testing, the inputs to 'modelTest.py' must be in '.txt' format, where different data points are separated by Spaces, eg. 'point1 point2 ... point4096'.

Prior to input into the network model, the FID data containing less than 4096 complex points needs to be zero-filled to 4096 complex points and Fourier transformed. Then, the spectrum is phased, and only the real part is taken and normalized to 1.

If FID contains more than 4096 complex points or the spectral width is larger than 4096 Hz, FID can be zero-filled to 8192 or more (integer multiple of 4096) complex points, then the corresponding spectrum can be divided into two or more spectra with 4096 real points as inputs, and finally the processed spectra can be concatenated into a complete spectrum.
