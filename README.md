# Generating Dataset and Training Model


# Preparing Data for Testing
When testing, the inputs to 'modelTest.py' must be in '.txt' format, where different data points are separated by Spaces, eg. 'point1 point2 ... point4096'. 'load_Varian_fid_to_spec.m' provides the methods to prepare data for testing and save data as '.txt' format. Running 'load_Varian_fid_to_spec.m' can convert the real time ZS FID data acquired on the Agilent NMR System into '.txt' format required by 'modelTest.py'.

Prior to input into the network model, the FID data containing less than 4096 complex points needs to be zero-filled to 4096 complex points and Fourier transformed. Then, the spectrum is phased, and only the real part is taken and normalized to 1.

If FID contains more than 4096 complex points or the spectral width is larger than 4096 Hz, FID can be zero-filled to 8192 or more (integer multiple of 4096) complex points, then the corresponding spectrum can be divided into two or more spectra with 4096 real points as inputs, and finally the processed spectra can be concatenated into a complete spectrum.
